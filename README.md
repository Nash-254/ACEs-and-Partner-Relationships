# ACEs and Partner Relationships

## Project Overview
This project explores how **Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)** shape adult relationships, partner choice, and long-term family outcomes. It seeks to investigates the phenomenon of **assortative mating by adversity**—the tendency for individuals with similar ACE histories to form partnerships—and examines how **shared childhood trauma affects relationship quality, mental + physical health, and socioeconomic well-being.**

## Data Source
The data used in this project is drawn from **peer-reviewed journals** mainly from [Plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/) and [ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/) which are open access to the public.

The data in the studies was obtained from 818 couples in Sweden and a large sample of functionally independent older Japanese adults aged 65+ yrs.

## Project Objectives
The project aims to:

**1. To examine assortative mating by adversity**
- Identify patterns of partner similarity in reported Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and determine whether individuals with specific ACE histories are more likely to pair with partners who share similar experiences.
***(Data source: Table 3 — Odds ratios of partner ACE associations)***

**2. To assess the cumulative impact of shared ACE exposure on relationship and family outcomes**
- Compare socioeconomic, emotional, and health outcomes across ACE exposure groups (none, one partner high, both high) to determine how shared childhood adversity affects relationship quality and family well-being. ***(Data source: Table 4 — Couples’ outcomes)***

## Tools & Technologies Used
A hybrid approach integrated **SQL’s efficiency** in data extraction, schema design, and structured data management with **Python’s powerful statistical analysis** and **rich visualization** capabilities, delivering a workflow that was both efficient and insight-driven.
- **PostgreSQL**: Schema design and initial data analysis using SQL.
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
  - **SQLAlchemy + psycopg2**: For working with SQL databases directly within Python; database connection and analysis queries.
  - **Pandas**: For analyzing data and visualization Integration.
  - **Matplotlib**: For creating basic charts and graphs.
  - **Seaborn**: For more advanced and visually appealing plots.
- **VS Code**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for scripting and data handling.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An interactive environment for combining code, text, and visuals in one document.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control.
