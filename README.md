It seeks to investigates the phenomenon of **assortative mating by adversity**—the tendency for individuals with similar ACE histories to form partnerships—and examines how shared childhood trauma affects relationship quality, mental health, and socioeconomic well-being.
## Data Source

## Project Objectives

## Tools & Technologies Used
A hybrid approach integrated **SQL’s efficiency** in data extraction, schema design, and structured data management with **Python’s powerful statistical analysis** and **rich visualization** capabilities, delivering a workflow that was both efficient and insight-driven.
- **PostgreSQL**: Schema design and initial data analysis using SQL.
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
  - **SQLAlchemy + psycopg2**: For working with SQL databases directly within Python; database connection and analysis queries.
  - **Pandas**: For analyzing data and visualization Integration.
  - **Matplotlib**: For creating basic charts and graphs.
  - **Seaborn**: For more advanced and visually appealing plots.
- **VS Code**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for scripting and data handling.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An interactive environment for combining code, text, and visuals in one document.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control.
